excerpt: 'We audited four ChatGPT versions with 98,800 prompts each for bias in salary negotiation advice. We found statistically significant gaps by gender, university, and major, with the largest variations between model versions and employee vs. employer perspectives. Results were inconsistent across versions, raising concerns about using ChatGPT for contextual tasks without clear ground truth.'
