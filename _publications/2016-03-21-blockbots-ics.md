excerpt: This article introduces and discusses bot-based collective blocklists (or
  blockbots) in Twitter, which have been developed by volunteers to combat harassment
  in the social networking site in a more decentralized and counterpublic way than
  actions taken by Twitter, Inc. staff. I discuss how such forms of automation require
  that communities encode specific understandings of what harassment is and how to
  identify it, relating these cases to several longstanding issues around the governance
  and moderation of the public sphere.

Abstract: This article introduces and discusses bot-based collective blocklists (or blockbots) in Twitter, which have been developed by volunteers to combat harassment in the social networking site. Blockbots support the curation of a shared blocklist of accounts, where subscribers to a blockbot will not receive any notifications or messages from accounts on the blocklist. Blockbots support counterpublic communities, helping people moderate their own experiences of a site. This article provides an introduction and overview of blockbots and the issues that they raise about networked publics and platform governance, extending an intersecting literature on online harassment, platform governance, and the politics of algorithms.
