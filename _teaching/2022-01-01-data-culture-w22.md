## THIS IS A DRAFT SYLLABUS -- DETAILS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE

## COMM 106D: Data and Culture -- Winter 2022

**Instructor:** Prof. Stuart Geiger (COMM106D@stuartgeiger.com)

**Time:** MW 9-9:50am, F asynchronous and online (blended mode)

### Overview

**Course summary:** We are constantly told that we are living in a “datafied” world, in the “age of information,” in which “data is the new oil” and “data-driven” artificial intelligence will replace humanity. In response, this course takes a cultural lens to issues around data and AI, organized around three related themes: representations of data and AI in popular culture and media; how the culture industries are using data and AI in their work; and the internal culture and issues within the data and AI professions.

First, we will ask how data collection, data analytics, and AI are discussed and represented in popular culture, media, and politics. What are the tropes, metaphors, slogans, and discourses we rely on when we try to make sense of these issues? How accurate are these representations and what do they miss about how data and AI actually work? Second, we will discuss how the traditional culture industries --- such as film, music, television, journalism, sports, or art --- are using data science and AI to make key decisions in their work. How does micro-targeting work, and what are the implications of giving us the search results that will keep our eyeballs on the screen the longest? Finally, we will study the internal cultural practices and norms within the emerging fields and professions of data science and AI. How do data scientists, developers, and engineers understand their work and their relationship to society? How are these fields and professions reckoning with (or ignoring) issues around diversity, inclusion, and equity?

**Relationship to other COMM courses:** This course may have a some amount of overlap with related courses in the department, including COMM 106E (Data, Science, and Society, which I’ll teach in S22), COMM 106I (Internet Industries), and COMM 162 (Culture Industries). However, it is designed to take a different perspective and cover a different set of topics. We will largely \*not\* be focusing on topics that are more central to these other courses, such as the role of data and AI in sectors like criminal justice, surveillance, banking, hiring, admissions, welfare benefits, or science --- which will be the focus on 106E in S22.

**Scheduling and hybrid format (this will not change):** This class is scheduled as an in-person class at MWF 9-9:50am. Monday and Wednesday will be in-person, with no hybrid participation option available. The Friday “hour” will be an asynchronous online participation component, which must be completed at a time of your choice between the end of class on Wednesday and 11:59pm on Friday.

**Prerequisites (this will not change):** This is an intermediate elective, so only COMM 10 as a prereq or a co-req. This means you can enroll in this class at the same time as taking COMM 10. You must submit an EASY request after enrolling in COMM 10. See<https://communication.ucsd.edu/undergrad/academic-overview/faqs.html#I-want-to-enroll-in-COMM-10-and>. No other prereqs are required. We will learn some aspects about how data science and AI works, but this course assumes no prior knowledge of computing.

### Assessment (some details may change):

- 15% Mon/Wed in-person participation (you can miss up to 3 classes unexcused; 4 unexcused absences will be penalized 1 letter grade)

- 15% Friday virtual participation

- 20% Take home assignments (3 assignments, lowest grade dropped):

  - Critique a representation of data/AI
  - Report on the use of data in a culture industry
  - Response to a data controversy

- 20% Group midterm performance/skit/parody project, comprised of:

  - 5% proposal
  - 10% group grade, with points distributed by group members
  - 5% statement of group work

- 30% Final, comprised of:

  - 5% Final paper/project proposal
  - 25% Final paper/project

**Midterm:** The midterm will be a group performance project, in which groups of 3-5 students will produce a 5-7 minute segment on a topic related to the class. You will have to propose the topic beforehand. You are free to choose the format, genre, and whether it is recorded or live.

**Final:** The final will be a final paper/project of your choice, in which you analyze cultural representations around data, report on data practices in a culture industry, and/or discuss an issue within the data professions. You can also propose an alternative topic. The default format for the final project is a 6-8 page paper, but students who have experience with filmmaking, creative writing, web design, data science, etc., can propose an alternative format drawing on their skills.
