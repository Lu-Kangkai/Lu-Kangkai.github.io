**The Hidden Labor of Scaling Open-Source Projects**

Free and open-source software (F/OSS) projects have a massive impact on our society. They form the backbone of critical digital infrastructure, supporting everything from major corporations to academic research and non-profit initiatives. However, as these projects grow and scale, the challenges faced by those who maintain them often go unnoticed. I want to share insights from [our recent study](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3449249), where we delved into the labor involved in maintaining and scaling F/OSS projects, and offer recommendations on how we can better support these essential contributors.

This work is part of a broader set of projects funded by the Sloan and Ford Foundations as part of their focus on Digital Infrastructure, check out the other [amazing work from other grantees here](https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/learning-reflections/critical-digital-infrastructure-research/).


**Our Study: Understanding the Maintainer's Journey**

We embarked on this research to explore how the work of maintainers evolves as F/OSS projects grow. We conducted 37 in-depth interviews with maintainers and contributors from a diverse range of projects—some with a single developer, others with hundreds of contributors and millions of users. Our participants spanned 14 countries and brought a wealth of perspectives to the table.

Our primary focus was on projects that started as volunteer-driven efforts but have since become critical infrastructure relied upon by others. We wanted to understand not just the technical aspects of maintenance—like fixing bugs or updating code—but also the often-invisible interpersonal and organizational work that keeps these communities thriving.

**Key Findings: The Changing Landscape of Maintenance Work**

1. **Expansion of Responsibilities**: Maintainers do far more than code. As projects scale, they find themselves managing user support, handling an influx of contributions, and navigating complex interpersonal dynamics. The role becomes less about coding and more about leadership and community management.  
2. **User Support Overload**: For small projects, user queries are opportunities for growth and engagement. However, as user bases expand, maintainers often face an overwhelming number of support requests, sometimes leading to burnout. The emotional labor of managing demanding or disrespectful users adds to this burden.  
3. **Scaling Trust Through Code Review**: With more contributors, maintainers need robust processes to ensure code quality and security. This often involves formalizing code review practices and implementing systems like continuous integration (CI) and automated testing. While these tools help manage workload, they also require additional setup and maintenance.  
4. **Interdependence in Software Ecosystems**: Large projects often exist within ecosystems of interdependent software. Maintainers must coordinate with upstream and downstream projects, which can involve complex negotiations and sometimes conflicts, especially when consolidations or major changes occur.  
5. **Evangelizing and Community Building**: Maintainers frequently engage in outreach to grow their user and contributor base. This "evangelizing" involves speaking at conferences, writing documentation, and more. While crucial, it demands time and energy that could otherwise be spent on the project itself.  
6. **Financial and Organizational Challenges**: As projects grow, funding becomes a critical issue. Maintainers often grapple with fundraising, managing donations, and dealing with financial administration—all tasks that require skills beyond software development.  
7. **Hypervisibility and Microcelebrity**: Successful maintainers can become highly visible figures, leading to increased scrutiny and pressure. This hypervisibility can exacerbate stress and detract from the maintainer's ability to focus on the project.

**Our Recommendations: Supporting Maintainers in a Scaling World**

Based on our findings, we believe it's crucial to address the challenges maintainers face as their projects grow. Here are some recommendations for practitioners, stakeholders, and funders:

1. **Recognize and Compensate All Forms of Labor**: Maintenance isn't just about coding. Acknowledge the organizational, communicative, and emotional labor that maintainers perform. Consider compensating maintainers for this work, either financially or through support services.  
2. **Implement Sustainable Contribution Models**: Encourage projects to develop clear guidelines for contributions and code reviews. Automated tools like CI can help, but they require investment. Supporting these infrastructures can reduce the burden on maintainers.  
3. **Foster Healthy Communities**: As projects scale, actively work on community management. This includes moderating discussions, enforcing codes of conduct, and ensuring that new contributors feel welcomed and supported.  
4. **Provide Funding and Resources Thoughtfully**: Funders should be mindful of the administrative burden that comes with seeking and managing grants. Simplify application processes where possible and consider providing funding for operational costs, not just new features or innovations.  
5. **Encourage Distribution of Responsibilities**: Maintainers shouldn't have to shoulder all responsibilities. Encourage the development of governance structures that distribute tasks like user support, event planning, and fundraising among a broader group.  
6. **Support Maintainers' Well-being**: Be aware of the risks of burnout and overwork. Offer resources for mental health support and encourage maintainers to set boundaries to maintain a healthy work-life balance.  
7. **Large Stakeholder Organizations Giving Back**: Companies and institutions that rely on F/OSS projects should contribute back, whether through funding, code contributions, or other resources. This helps distribute the maintenance burden more equitably. However, this also takes labor to manage various kinds of contributions.

**Conclusion: Building a Sustainable Future for F/OSS**

Our study highlights that as F/OSS projects become integral to our digital infrastructure, the labor required to maintain them becomes more complex and demanding. Maintainers are often caught in a cycle of increasing responsibilities without corresponding support or recognition. By implementing the recommendations above, we can create a more sustainable ecosystem that values and supports the essential work of maintainers. This not only benefits the maintainers themselves but also strengthens the projects we all rely on.
