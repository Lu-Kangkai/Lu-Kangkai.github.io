# **The Language Dynamics of Free and Open-Source Software Communities**

Free and open-source software (FOSS) has become an indispensable part of global digital infrastructure. These projects thrive on the contributions of unpaid volunteers, whose efforts fuel innovation and ensure the ongoing development and maintenance of software relied upon by individuals, organizations, and governments worldwide. Yet, this dependence on volunteer labor is also a vulnerability: sustaining these communities hinges on their ability to recruit and retain contributors.

This blog post summarizes [a recent research paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cogs.13134) in which my collaborators and I investigated how patterns of communication, particularly sentiment and expressions of gratitude, influence newcomer retention in FOSS projects. In the context of open collaboration platforms like GitHub, the interactions between contributors leave a rich digital record, offering unique opportunities to analyze the social and linguistic dynamics at play in these communities. For practitioners and stakeholders, understanding these dynamics is vital to fostering sustainable, inclusive, and thriving software communities.

# **Study Overview**

This research analyzed communication patterns in eight widely-used FOSS projects hosted on GitHub, including scientific Python libraries such as numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. The dataset comprised over 500,000 activities, including issue posts, PRs, and their associated comments, contributed by more than 19,000 individuals. Using natural language processing techniques, the study quantified sentiment (positive/negative tone) and expressions of gratitude in these interactions.

Key variables included the contributor's community membership status (newcomer vs. established member), the type of activity, and the context of the interaction. The analysis examined how these factors shaped language use and their subsequent impact on the retention of first-time contributors. By exploring language as a dynamic system influenced by community-specific norms and contexts, the study provides actionable insights for improving contributor engagement and fostering healthier FOSS communities.

# **Understanding FOSS Communities**

## **FOSS as Communities of Practice**

FOSS projects are not just about writing code—they are dynamic communities of practice (CoPs) where newcomers learn the norms and practices through participation. From lightweight activities like reporting bugs to more complex contributions such as proposing code changes via pull requests (PRs), these projects enable a process of social learning and enculturation. This dynamic not only drives individual growth but also sustains the long-term health of the project.

## **Challenges in Contributor Recruitment and Retention**

Despite their success, FOSS communities face persistent challenges. Newcomers often struggle with technical barriers, unclear norms, and a lack of social integration. Negative experiences, such as a lack of feedback or rudeness from established members, can deter first-time contributors. Conversely, the perception of being welcomed and supported is critical to motivating newcomers to return.

# **The Role of Language in Community Health**

## **Sentiment and Gratitude**

The study examined language use in issues and pull requests, finding that language can be central to community interactions. Sentiment—positive or negative emotional tone—and expressions of gratitude reflect the social-emotional health of the community and impact volunteers’ likelihood to continue with the project. Positive sentiment fosters inclusivity and collaboration, while gratitude acknowledges contributions and strengthens social bonds. However, the ways these linguistic elements manifest vary depending on the activity type (e.g., posting issues vs. commenting on PRs) and the contributor’s role (member vs. non-member).

## **Key Findings on Language Dynamics**

1. **Sentiment Differences Across Activities**: Positive sentiment was more common in comments than in original posts, and PR-related activities were generally more positive than issue-related activities. Interestingly, non-members displayed higher positivity in PR posts than members, possibly signaling a deliberate effort to align with community norms.  
2. **Gratitude Dynamics**: Non-members expressed significantly more gratitude than members. This discrepancy highlights gratitude as a potential strategy for non-members to build goodwill within the community. Gratitude was particularly prominent in PR comments, underscoring the importance of collaborative feedback in sustaining contributor engagement.  
3. **Community-Specific Patterns**: Language use varied widely across communities. For instance, some communities were consistently more positive or expressed more gratitude, while others demonstrated more variability. These differences suggest that each FOSS project develops unique norms and communication styles, which can shape newcomer experiences and influence retention.

# **Retention of New Contributors**

## **The Newcomer Experience**

Retention of newcomers is a critical indicator of community health. The study revealed that:

* **PRs vs. Issues**: Newcomers who made their first contribution via a PR were more likely to return compared to those whose first post was an issue. This suggests that engaging in substantive, creative contributions may foster a stronger connection to the community.  
* **Impact of Feedback**: Positive sentiment and expressions of gratitude in responses to newcomers’ contributions were strong predictors of retention. However, the type of contribution moderated this effect. For example, constructive criticism combined with appreciation was especially motivating for PR contributors, while simple validation was more effective for issue posters.

## **Community Responsiveness**

Responsiveness played a significant role in retention. For issue contributions, a longer time before resolution increased the likelihood of newcomers returning, potentially reflecting the value of thoughtful engagement. Conversely, faster responses were better for PR contributions, highlighting the importance of efficiency in collaborative work.

# **Implications for FOSS Stakeholders**

## **Tailoring Communication Strategies**

FOSS practitioners can improve newcomer retention by aligning their communication strategies with the context of the contribution:

* **For Issue Posters**: Provide validation and encouragement, even for small contributions. Acknowledge the effort and thank newcomers explicitly to foster a sense of recognition.  
* **For PR Contributors**: Offer constructive but supportive feedback. A balance of critique and gratitude not only helps newcomers improve but also encourages them to continue contributing.

## **Fostering Inclusive Community Norms**

Community leaders and maintainers should actively shape norms that prioritize positive and inclusive interactions. Setting expectations for timely responses, constructive feedback, and gratitude can establish a welcoming environment that attracts and retains contributors.

## **Recognizing the Unique Dynamics of Each Community**

Every FOSS community is distinct. Tailoring strategies to the specific culture and norms of a project can ensure that interventions are effective. For instance, a project with a history of low gratitude may benefit from explicit efforts to encourage appreciation, while one with high positivity might focus on maintaining this strength.

## **Leveraging Tools for Community Health**

GitHub and other platforms offer tools to monitor and improve community interactions. Features like sentiment analysis, semi-automated gratitude acknowledgments, and newcomer-specific onboarding messages can complement human efforts to sustain healthy dynamics.

# **Insights for Funders and Stakeholders**

FOSS is critical digital infrastructure, and its sustainability requires investment not only in the code but also in the people who create it. Funders can support initiatives aimed at improving community health, such as:

* **Training for Maintainers**: Programs that teach community leaders how to foster positive communication and resolve conflicts.  
* **Incentivizing Gratitude and Feedback**: Funding mechanisms that reward projects demonstrating high levels of newcomer engagement and retention.  
* **Supporting Research**: Continued investigation into the social and emotional dynamics of FOSS communities can yield actionable insights for improving retention.

# **Conclusion: Building Sustainable FOSS Communities**

The health of FOSS communities depends on their ability to recruit and retain contributors in the face of increasing reliance on their work. This research highlights the pivotal role of communication in shaping contributor experiences and sustaining community dynamics. By fostering positive interactions, expressing gratitude, and tailoring feedback to the context of contributions, FOSS practitioners and stakeholders can ensure the longevity of these vital digital ecosystems.

As open-source practitioners and funders, investing in the social fabric of FOSS projects is not just an ethical imperative—it is a practical necessity to secure the future of the software that powers our world.
